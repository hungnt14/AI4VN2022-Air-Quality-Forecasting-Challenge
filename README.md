# AI4VN2022 - Air Quality Forecasting: Team LQDBD

## Our approach
In this solution, we try to develop several models:
- [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)
- [CatBoost](https://github.com/catboost/catboost)
- [LSTM]()

## Reproduce our results

### Install required packages
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .
```
### Data
We have put all contest data in this repo, you can move to `data/` folder to see its structure and create a custom dataset if you want.
### Running
We have provided all essential scripts that you could run to reproduce our results. You can look at these scripts to see the required params (if you want to tinker it).
# Contact
If you have any issue while running, raise an issue or privately mail [us](mailto:ngtienhung14@gmail.com).
